# Dual Axis Solar Tracking System

 

## Overview

The Dual Axis Solar Tracking System is an innovative project designed to optimize the efficiency of solar panels by tracking the sun's position throughout the day. This system uses two axes of movement to ensure that the solar panels are always aligned with the sun, maximizing energy absorption and improving overall performance.

## Features

- **Dual Axis Tracking:** Moves solar panels along both azimuth and elevation axes for optimal sun alignment.
- **High Efficiency:** Increases solar energy capture by maintaining optimal panel orientation.
- **Automated Control:** Uses sensors and microcontrollers to automate tracking without human intervention.
- **Real-Time Data Monitoring:** Provides live data on panel orientation and energy output.
- **Weather Adaptability:** Adjusts tracking speed and position based on weather conditions.

## Components

- **Solar Panels**
- **Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)**
- **LDR Sensors**
- **Servo Motors**
- **Mounting Hardware**
- **Power Supply**

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aapush01/dual-axis-solar-tracking-system.git
   cd dual-axis-solar-tracking-system

### Hardware Setup

1. Assemble the frame and mount the solar panels.
2. Connect the servo motors to the frame for dual-axis movement.
3. Connect LDR sensors to the microcontroller for sunlight detection.
4. Ensure all wiring is secure and correct according to the circuit diagram provided in the `docs` folder.
